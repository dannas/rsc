Missed that bytecode[ip++] and bytecode[ip + 1] are not equivalent.
    Found by distilling the problem into a small test program.

Wasted time trying to trace the execution by singlestepping.
    Wrote ostream overloads for tracing the execution.
        Much easier to get an overview.

Forgot that the ip is incremented at end of interpret loop.
    Used separate var for keeping track of ip and opcode.
        Allowed me to remove special case adjustments of ip for operands.

Using a separate ADT for the stack makes it harder to add fp support
    Added separate functions for it - a bit clunky though.

Made an off-by-one error when accessing parameters as offsets from fp.
    Detected by inspecting the execution trace.
    Fixed by storing correct fp.

The assembler had missing consume() calls for some token types.
    Added those.

The assembler did not handle negative numbers
    Added an expression to match those as well.

Got weird compilation failures when I extracted some parts into opcodes.h
	I don't have enough time to relearn make, I'll use cmake instead.

Matched argv[1] against address of string literal
    Caught by compiler.
    Fixed by replacing
        if (argv[1] == "--test")
    with
        if (strcmp(argv[1], "--test") == 0)

The initial feeding of the lexer token lookahead character was not done by
consume().
    
Read byte-by-byte in disassembler when I intended int-by-int.
Mixed parameters to fread(3) in the disassembler.
Forgot to change all calls from fgetc to fread.

Mixed up the calling convention, causing asserts that were hard for me to
diagnose. Found the problem quickly when I added unit tests to the byte
interpreter.

Switching from cstdio to iostream caused a lot of needless churn.
    Should have just sticked to iostream from the beginning.

Wasted a lot of time debugging some example programs. I should have used unit
tests from the beginning.
