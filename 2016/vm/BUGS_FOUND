Missed that bytecode[ip++] and bytecode[ip + 1] are not equivalent.
    Found by distilling the problem into a small test program.

Wasted time trying to trace the execution by singlestepping.
    Wrote ostream overloads for tracing the execution.
        Much easier to get an overview.

Forgot that the ip is incremented at end of interpret loop.
    Used separate var for keeping track of ip and opcode.
        Allowed me to remove special case adjustments of ip for operands.
