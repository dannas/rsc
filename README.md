# Random source code.

This repository contains unpolished and - for most cases - uncompleted code that I've written for learning purposes. Others use gists for keeping track of similar things.

A reimplementation of the C++ standard library. It prioritizes readability over completeness and performance.

## [Cryptopals](2016/cryptopals)

Solutions to the [Matasano Crypto Challenge](https://cryptopals.com/).

## [Vm](2016/vm)

A stack based machine similar to p-code or the Java stack machine. Includes an interpreter; disassembler; a minimal compiler that uses the system stack for pops and pushes; and a compiler that keeps stack values in a compiler stack in the style of Firefox Webassembly baseline JIT compiler.
